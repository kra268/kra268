## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm an enthusiastic computational chemist working at Idaho National Laboratory (INL). Here you'll find a variety of projects that showcase my work and contributions in the field of computational chemistry. Let's connect, collaborate, and innovate together!\
I am not very active on this page as you can see, but you can find more of my work based on what we release from INL.

## Where to find my work

I use this page for some creative projects and my past projects while I was a graduate student. To find more recent work I do, they are on my INL GitHub, which unfortunately cannot be made public. 

## YouTube

My YouTube channel is called ChemCoder where I help others transition into the field of AI and ML.
